53	Exam3_Q23	0: Incorrect, 1: Correct; Which of the following is an assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg principle? A. New mutations are frequently lost; B. New mutations can drift to high frequency in small populations; C. New mutations can drift to high frequency in large populations; D. New mutations do not occur
54	Exam3_Q24	0: Incorrect, 1: Correct; In a population that has always been in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and does not violate any HWE assumptions, if there are no heterozygotes at a particular locus, then: A. There were never multiple alleles at the locus. B. Selection likely removed the heterozygotes. C. Only a subset of the population reproduced and one allele drifted to fixation at that locus. D. Migration from a neighboring population wiped out variation at this locus.
55	Exam3_Q25	0: Incorrect, 1: Correct; A disorder that causes nearsightedness is caused by a genetic mutation. Nearsightedness was harmful to people living on a small island because they relied on sight to interpret their surroundings. In the 1600s, a huge storm killed many of the people on the island. Before the storm, 0.1% of the people had this disorder. Of the 50 people who survived the storm, 2% were nearsighted. Within a few generations, 10% of the islanders were nearsighted. If we infer that the frequency of nearsighted individuals could be evidence for genetic drift, which of the following statements are true? (1) Nearsightedness must have become more common through natural selection. (2) Nearsightedness must have become more common through new mutations. A. Both (1) and (2); B. Neither (1) nor (2); C. Only (1); D. Only (2)
